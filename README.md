This project implements a sentiment analysis system using machine learning techniques. It classifies user reviews as either positive or negative based on a Bernoulli Naive Bayes model. The system preprocesses text by removing HTML tags, special characters, stopwords, and applying stemming. The text is then converted into numerical features using a Bag of Words (BoW) model. The trained model is serialized with pickle for future use. This project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning, from data preprocessing and model training to deploying the trained model for sentiment prediction.
